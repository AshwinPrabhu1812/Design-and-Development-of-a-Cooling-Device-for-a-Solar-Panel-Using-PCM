# Design-and-Development-of-a-Cooling-Device-for-a-Solar-Panel-Using-PCM
  Passive cooling system for a 5W solar PV panel using PCM 32, increasing conversion efficiency by 16.5%.  Achieved a 13.22Â°C average temperature decrease, boosting electrical efficiency by 2%. Compared to uncooled panels, the  PV-PCM panel with aluminum as TCE demonstrated a 20% increase in electrical power output.
